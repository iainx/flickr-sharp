-- flickr-sharp/Flickr.Net library 2.1.3 release --

The flickr-sharp/Flickr.Net API is a .Net Library for accessing the Flickr API. Written 
entirely in C# it can be accessed from with any .Net language in .Net Framework 1.1 and 
.Net Framework 2.0. We are working trying to get it working in the .NET Compact Framework.

You can contact me at sam AT wackylabs.net if you'd like to join the project.
